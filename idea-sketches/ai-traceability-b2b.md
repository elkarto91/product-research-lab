# 🔍 AI + Traceability for B2B Sustainability Reporting

## 🚩 Problem
B2B companies struggle to produce transparent, verifiable sustainability disclosures. Manual data entry, supplier opaqueness, and a lack of automation make ESG compliance inefficient and vulnerable to greenwashing.

## 💡 Concept
Use a hybrid architecture combining:
- Blockchain for audit-proof traceability across suppliers
- AI for extracting and validating ESG claims from invoices, transport records, and certifications

## 🔧 Components
- OCR + LLM for document understanding (energy use, carbon impact, fair trade flags)
- Smart contract-based storage of key checkpoints (on-chain provenance)
- Dashboard with AI anomaly detection ("X% deviation from baseline")

## 🎯 Target Use Case
- EU Scope 3 emissions reporting
- Coffee, cocoa, apparel supply chains
- Mid-size suppliers serving enterprise clients with ESG goals

## ✅ MVP Value
- Report-ready traceable data
- Trust layer between orgs
- Positioning as “audit-prepared” by design
